Sure, I can suggest a dark themed color palette that is accessible to people with color blindness.

When designing a website, it's essential to consider the different types of color blindness, such as protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. To ensure accessibility, it's recommended to use high-contrast color combinations, avoid relying on color alone to convey information, and use color palettes that are distinguishable by people with different types of color vision deficiencies.

Here is a dark-themed color palette that meets accessibility standards:

Dark Grey: #333333
Light Grey: #999999
White: #FFFFFF
Blue: #0072C6
Yellow: #FFC72C
Green: #4CAF50
Red: #FF5722
This palette has a good contrast between light and dark shades, making it easy to distinguish different elements on the website. Additionally, it includes a range of colors that are distinguishable by people with different types of color blindness. For example, the blue and yellow colors are distinguishable by people with deuteranopia, while the green and yellow colors are distinguishable by people with protanopia.

It's important to note that color palettes should be tested for accessibility using color blindness simulators or tools, such as the Chrome extension "Color Enhancer," to ensure they are truly accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.
